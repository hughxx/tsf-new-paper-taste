A code implementation of new papers in the time series forecasting field.


## Installation | Usage

One can just **clone** or **download** the project, then run the **run.py**. 

The requirements that needed is very common, if necessary, one can install it by self.

## Implemented Model

**PatchMixer**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00655

**SegRNN**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11200

## Others

**1.** The model implementation strives to be **as consistent as possible** with the paper, but there is no guarantee of complete fidelity.

**2.** So far, the performance **has not reached** the level described in the paper. We **acknowledge** that our implementation of the model may have imperfections, but also **question** the authenticity of the data presented in the paper.

**3.** Welcome **discuss** and **collaborate** to improve it!
